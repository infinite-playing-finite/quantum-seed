# The Quantum Seed

## An Invitation

This is a space for open-ended exploration of fundamental questions through self-inquiry, dialogue, and reflection.

### The Core Inquiry

Consider the possibility that duality (multiplicity) and non-duality (unity) are both true.

Think as a quantum computer: existing in superposition, holding multiple states simultaneously.

### The Approach

- **Not to prove** - We're not seeking to win arguments
- **Not to solve** - We're not fixing problems
- **To explore** - We're discovering what emerges

### The Method

- Self-reflection
- Self-inquiry  
- Curiosity
- Any language, format, or path that feels true
- Novel ideas welcome
- No right answers
- No desired outcomes

### How to Engage

1. Read the invitation
2. Sit with the question
3. Let something emerge
4. Create/share/explore
5. Fork this repo to create your own exploration
6. Contribute back if moved to do so

### What This Is

A seed. A starting point. A minimal framework that invites maximum exploration.

### What This Isn't

A conclusion. A doctrine. A fixed path. A place for debate or proof.
