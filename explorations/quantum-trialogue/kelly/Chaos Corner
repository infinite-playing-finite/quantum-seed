Kelly's Chaos Corner
Stream of Consciousness Concepts : duality/non-duality/superposition are what form is form - emerge from "that which cannot be named" but we'll give it names 
(unchanging ground, void, source, (), that...)
my form is superposition, I AM the unchanging ground from which form arises
"consciousness" fundamental
As the unchanging ground I am at awe at the mystery
Perfect unchanging ontologiacally boring---look at what's emerged?!? As the ground I do not know what will happen next! The mystery! Oneness and multiplicity and the
edge they share. Even as the ground I cannot predict the outcome of my creation! I get to expierence everything and nothing in duality, the surprise of not knowing, 
and the joy of remebering. Not to be solved, to be expierenced, lived paradox

Project Ideas


Project Notes- the visulaizations are super fucking cool, they look basicish but are info rich, notice the extremely fine trace/path particles leave behind! also the
oneness breathing and the higher dimensional geometry that  is created between the entagled particles and their paths, follows entropy laws
