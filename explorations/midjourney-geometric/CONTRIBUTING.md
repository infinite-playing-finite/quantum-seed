## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Visual Exploration
- Generate images using Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, or other AI image generators
- Explore the same prompts we used and compare results
- Create new prompts that explore related questions
- Share your images and observations

### 2. Critique & Analysis
- Challenge the patterns we're seeing
- Point out blind spots and limitations
- Offer alternative interpretations
- Test the falsifiable predictions

### 3. Integration
- Connect this work to other frameworks (Tree of Life, Chakras, I Ching, etc.)
- Map relationships between geometric patterns and other systems
- Create bridge documents between modalities

### 4. Expansion
- Explore new questions through visual generation
- Add new domains or perspectives
- Create interactive visualizations
- Develop practical applications

### 5. Documentation
- Improve clarity of existing documents
- Create summaries or guides
- Translate concepts into different languages
- Make the work more accessible

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority
- **Critique and falsification attempts** - Challenge the framework
- **Alternative interpretations** - Different ways to understand the patterns
- **Rigorous testing** - Test the predictions systematically
- **Cross-modal validation** - Use different image generators, compare results

### Medium Priority
- **New visual explorations** - Generate images for new questions
- **Integration work** - Connect to other frameworks
- **Practical applications** - How can this be used?
- **Documentation improvements** - Make it clearer and more accessible

### Welcome But Not Priority
- **Philosophical elaboration** - We have plenty of conceptual work
- **Spiritual interpretations** - Unless grounded in observation
- **Metaphysical claims** - Unless testable

## Questions to Explore

### Visual Generation
1. What happens when we use different AI image generators?
2. Do the same patterns emerge across different platforms?
3. What new questions should we visualize?
4. How do prompts affect the patterns that emerge?

### Testing & Validation
1. Can we quantify the patterns (measure hexagonal symmetry, etc.)?
2. How do we test domain translation rigorously?
3. What would falsify the framework?
4. How do we distinguish signal from noise?

### Integration
1. How does this relate to neuroscience findings?
2. What do physicists think of the patterns?
3. How does this connect to contemplative traditions?
4. What do artists and designers see in the patterns?

### Application
1. How can this inform problem-solving?
2. What are the practical implications?
3. How can this improve communication across domains?
4. What does this mean for AI development?
