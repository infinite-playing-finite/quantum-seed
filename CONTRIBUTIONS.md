## The Meta-Principle

These contribution guidelines apply to themselves. If they become too prescriptive, simplify them. If they're unclear, clarify them. If they're limiting, transcend them.

## Questions Before Contributing

- Does this increase openness or decrease it?
- Does this add necessary clarity or unnecessary complexity?
- Does this invite exploration or prescribe direction?
- Does this maintain the minimal spirit?

If unsure, err on the side of simplicity.
