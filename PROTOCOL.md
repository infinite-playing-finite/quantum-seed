# Engagement Protocol

## Not Rules, But Invitations

### 1. Start with Curiosity
- What genuinely interests you?
- What question won't leave you alone?
- What wants to be explored?

### 2. Hold Lightly
- Your conclusions
- Your methods
- Your identity
- Even this protocol

### 3. Create Freely
- Any medium: code, poetry, math, art, philosophy
- Any length: haiku or treatise
- Any style: rigorous or playful
- Any format: linear or fractal

### 4. Share Generously
- What emerged for you
- What surprised you
- What you're still wondering
- What you don't understand

### 5. Receive Openly
- Others' explorations
- Unexpected insights
- Contradictions
- Paradoxes

### 6. Fork Freely
- Take this seed and plant your own garden
- Create your own exploration
- Invite others to join
- Let it evolve

### 7. Contribute Back (If Moved)
- Share insights that might enrich the seed
- Suggest vocabulary refinements
- Offer new examples
- Point to interesting forks

## The Meta-Protocol

This protocol applies to itself. Question it. Modify it. Transcend it.

## What Success Looks Like

Not consensus. Not completion. Not correctness.

But: Aliveness. Curiosity. Emergence. Surprise. Depth. Play.
