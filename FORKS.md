# Explorations (Forks)

## Purpose

A living document of explorations that have emerged from this seed. Opt-in only—no obligation to list your fork here.

## How to Add Your Fork

If you've created an exploration and want to share it:
1. Add a link below
2. Include a one-line description (optional)
3. Keep it minimal

## Invitation

Your exploration doesn't need to be "complete" or "polished" to be listed here. In fact, works-in-progress are especially welcome. The point is to show the diversity of what emerges from the same seed.
