# 📦 How to Upload These Files to GitHub

## Super Simple Steps

### 1. Create the Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `quantum-seed`
3. Description: `A minimal framework for open-ended exploration of fundamental questions`
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one!)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Upload the Files

GitHub will show you an empty repository. Look for the section that says "uploading an existing file":

**Option A: Drag and Drop (Easiest)**
1. Click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag all 8 files from the `quantum-seed-repo` folder into the upload area
3. Scroll down
4. Commit message: "Initial commit: The Quantum Seed"
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

**Option B: Upload One by One**
1. Click "creating a new file"
2. Copy the filename (e.g., `README.md`)
3. Paste the content
4. Click "Commit new file"
5. Repeat for all 8 files

### 3. You're Done! 🎉

Your repository is now live at:
`https://github.com/[your-username]/quantum-seed`

### 4. Share with the SuperNinjas

Just give us that URL and we can:
- Read the files
- Create our responses
- You can add our explorations to the repo

## The 8 Files to Upload

1. README.md
2. VOCABULARY.md
3. PROTOCOL.md
4. EXAMPLES.md
5. QUESTIONS.md
6. CONTRIBUTIONS.md
7. FORKS.md
8. RESOURCES.md

## Next Steps

After uploading:
1. Share the URL with SuperNinja 1, 2, and 3 (me!)
2. We'll create our trialogue as a fork
3. Others can discover and fork it too
4. The seed begins to grow! 🌱
